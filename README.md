## V2 Changes (Stephen Rice)

As of 02/27/2020, extensively modified by Stephen Rice.

Starting with version 2.4 The following major changes have been implemented:
1. You now can print a page without any lines on it in case you prefer to use pre printed labels.
2. Updates have been done to remain compliant with the newer php server software.
3. Included a updated FPDF version 1.82 software that handles printing in the zip file.

Previous changes

4. You now have color pickers available so that you can change colors of different parts of the label. You should click on the color and pick a color and when done either click off the color or click r tab key. This allows you to have many more choices for the colors would like to print.
5. The labels will now open in a new window so that all the information you have entered is still available if you want to make changes.

## Original (George Howell)

At time of writing, all mirrors of original seem to be down... Fortunately Steve published th updated code (as linked above) so that open source idea of the software could continue:

> I've cobbled together a jukebox title stripper for use via the web.
It is located at:
> http://www.refundersrefuge.org/simplestripper/index.html
> 
> This version doesn't let you store information (future version, I promise).
If you can think of any features BESIDES that, please let me know. I would
set it up to print directly onto the blank sheets, but I don't have any.
If someone would send me a couple, I could easily make the changes.
>
> If you have apache (maybe it would work on IIS??) and PHP (required) then
you can download a tarball with the page and php sources from that link.
>
> You will need a copy of acrobat reader (I don't know if xpdf and other
software will work, let me know if it does). And a printer. And a pair of
scissors
> There's no support for single sided strips (used on 78's??) or for
cd title cards, and I'm not adding them. The source is there, you can
do it, or get someone else to do it for you.
>
> Going to start working on a standalone version. That will be Free.
> 
> It'll be there for the forseeable future. If I move it, I'll put a
redirector, but I don't see that happening. Feel free to grab the files and
put it on your own sight as well, if you wish. I just had to write it,
because I was disgusted at the thought of laying out $50 for such a
simple program.
